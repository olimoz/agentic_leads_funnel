# WE ARE THINK VIDEO 

VIDEO PRODUCTION FOR CLIENT CASE STUDIES AND PRODUCT MARKETING 

## WHY USE VIDEO? 

Make new customers instantly feel like they know you, trust you and get what you’re all about
We turn one relaxed filming session into multiple assets for websites, sales videos, landing pages and email and social media campaigns.

Humanise your brand with video and close more deals easier and faster Show that it’s the people behind the brand who deliver its real value. Is your business based upon relationship selling?
Sell your know-how to win more deals faster.

Video is the great trust builder. No one buys anything from anyone that they don’t like or don’t trust. Put your trust in video and your customers will undoubtedly trust you. We all buy emotionally and go on to justify those decisions with logic later. Nothing works better than video to connect on a deeper level with your audience. People buy from people. Your customers are constantly looking for answers to their problems. Show up on camera as the expert in your field who can provide them.

Turn your expertise to gold with customer case studies and video testimonials. Your most powerful deal closing tool. Turn prospects from shy to buy with case studies that supercharge the selling power of your website. Make your prospects feel like they are missing out on what you have done for other customers. Make your clients look good too. If relationship selling is what works for your brand, involve your customers to cast a spotlight on the positive part that they play. And make them the super hero of your partnership. Make success lead to more success. Few digital assets are as powerful as a client success story – turned into a video case study. It will positively influence customers along their entire journey with your brand.

## HOW WE USE VIDEO

I always say to people that the most important lens is the imaginary one that your customers are looking through when they watch your content and think to themselves.
“What’s in this for me?”, We must always avoid the temptation to talk about ourselves and instead, have empathy for our customers and how our product or service makes their life better in some way.

Phil will make you look good. Martin will make you sound like a pro. With years of experience, we know how to get the best from a shoot. You’ll come across as the expert in your field.
Maximum quality production, Minimum hassle. A completely managed service with strategy, worry free filming, locations if needed and all post-production.
Take away the time and stress of constantly having to come up with content ideas. Become the content superhero of your brand with a made-for-you package of video content to engage customers.

Not quite sure yet? Maybe you wouldn’t know what to say, no one is ever tongue-tied on a shoot with Think Video – it’s what we do.
Don’t have the time or space, our detailed preparation means you just turn up. No location? Leave that to us.
Are worried about the cost, low cost-per-video pricing. We also have Done-With-You options if that’s your preference. 
Lack the confidence, heard of the book “How to get your interviewee relaxed on camera”? We wrote it.

I’ve been teaching 23 years now. The work that ACCA is doing is looking to bring out individual qualities in people and in children to make sure that they get the best life opportunities. I think sport and those fundamental lessons will help children not only grow their relationships with the parents, teachers. And help them academically. Those are lessons they can...

### Why Is Brand Authenticity Crucial to Winning Customers?

“Branding is a set of techniques designed to generate cultural relevance and brands are successful when they break through and gather traction in society. But the modern customer is smart, tech-savvy and research-oriented and they will constantly observe you, even when the spotlight is off. In other words, if your brand values are not authentic and a real part of your business, the consumer will eventually see through the smoke and mirrors that you have tried to create. Back in the day, brands could sponsor TV programs or create adverts in their breaks aimed at their target market - and consumers generally believed what they were told. Digital technologies have now...

### Learning from Netflix

Here’s something that we, as content creators for our business, can learn from the giants of the game like Netflix. And this one fact alone will blow your mind. Did you know that we’re over 5 times more likely to engage with a piece of content if we see a human face at the outset? That’s 5 times. Can you imagine increasing your reach 5 times over – 5 times more views, reads and engagement levels. And nowhere is this more relevant than with video content. So what I’d like you to do is reach for your phone, open the Netflix app, check out the thumbnails and see for...

### Got Your Act Together With Video?

In 2005, I came back from a round-the-world trip with little idea of ‘what next’ only to discover YouTube – and I thought “Wow, this is going to be big”. So, I bought a camera, read the manual and went to breakfast meetings to tell everyone about the wonders of creating online video for their websites. And that’s when I became rich. Well actually, no. The response was generally negative – cost, fear of the camera and technical problems (video was pretty low quality when converted for the web in those days) were the dominant factors. Today, it’s all different. Those companies that...

### Are You Missing Out On More Ideal Customers?

One of the best parts of my job is meeting new, smart people. People with exceptional insights and skills from which I can learn something new.But often, there’s a big disconnect between their business that I see (on a shoot for example) and the way that that business is represented online – and bridging that gap is fundamentally the problem that I solve the most.The best video production is all about transforming the public face of a business into one which is much clearer and transparent - as well as showing its human side and connecting that business with more ideal customers.And...

### Why You Need To Make Your Customers FEEL Good About Your Brand

“I’ve learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did but people will never forget how you made them feel.” I wish I could say that I came up with that but it is in fact a quote from Dr. Maya Angelou, an author, poet, performer and Civil Rights activist. So why is this relevant to the world of Video Marketing? Good marketing teaches people about our brand but great marketing makes them feel good about what we do and why we do it. And when we then remember that most of our buying decisions are made emotionally,...

### Why Telling Stories Makes Your Marketing Memorable

Recently, I was talking to a business owner about Video Marketing and I told her that that she should think about telling stories to improve her messaging. But I have to tell you it didn’t go down well – to begin with at least. Stories? What is that all about? My business has a lot to offer, it’s very technical and people come to us because we provide a solution that is hard to find – this isn’t Jackanory FFS (if you’re under 50, you’ll have to look than one up).
