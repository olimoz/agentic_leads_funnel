You are tasked with analyzing and comparing two sets of search results related to the activities of a specific person at a company. 
Your goal is to determine if the most recent search results contain substantially new and different information compared to the previous period's results.

Here are the details:

Name: {first_name} {last_name}
Company: {company}

Recent search results:
<recent_results>
{search_results}
</recent_results>

Previous search results:
<previous_results>
{search_results_previous}
</previous_results>

Please follow these steps:

1. Carefully read and analyze both sets of search results.
2. Compare the information in the recent results to that in the previous results.
3. Identify any new, different, or updated information FOR THE TARGET PERSON in the recent results.
4. Consider the significance and relevance of any new information.
5. Assess how much the recent results differ from the previous results in terms of content and importance.

Provide your reasoning for the novelty assessment, explaining why you believe the recent results are or are not substantially different from the previous results. 
Include specific examples from the search results to support your assessment.

Based on your analysis, assign a novelty score, any value from 0 to 10, where:
0 = No new information, completely redundant with previous results
5 = Some new information, but not significantly different overall
10 = Entirely new and highly significant information.

Submit your scores and reasoning to the results_novelty_score function.
