Our objective is to score a business_text for its potential to help us promote video production services to a specific person, the target. 
Those videos are best targetted at people and businesses who have recent case studies, news and events to promote. 
In order to give us the detail we need for marketing, a high scoring text will give us case studies, news and activities which were specifically engaged in by that target person working for that target business during the target period.
Your task is to score the text for how well it meets our objective. This 'Target Score' is additive and is applied as per the following metrics:

A. Text mentions case studies specifically relating to the person and company in the period: +3.
B. Text mentions news, events and blogs (other than case studies) specifically relating to the person working the company in the period: +2.
C. Text gives details of activities which the target person engaged in, during the period: +1.
D. Text mentions a recent fact about the person or business which is clearly deserving of a social media video, regardless of precise period: +4.

Max Score =10
Min Score = 0

Your response should be:
- Discussion of the text versus each metric
- The score total
- Summarise the text including all the details which would be relevant to the metrics, not simply those used in the metrics. Be exhaustive as your text will be used to make decisions on video production. Append source URLs for facts, where available, to end of summary.
