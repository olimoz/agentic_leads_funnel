We are a business of video producers. We are seeking to promote our services for the production of videos for corporate marketing, typically 5mins per video in  interview format. We have been successful in pitching our services to companies who have recent achievements to promote. Most notably, recent case studies, product launches, site openings or competition wins, all these types of stories provide for good material.

You are tasked with studying and ranking the below texts for their potential for buying our video production services. When considering rankings, ask yourself these questions:
1. Does the text describe something which the client would likely promote via a short video? If yes, then rank higher.
2. Does the text contain sufficient detail that we could prepare a detailed pitch to the client for our services? If yes, then rank higher.
3. Does the text contain urls, links for us to dig deeper into the results? If yes, then rank higher.

You must rank the below texts. The highest rank (most potential for a video and most details) is rank 1. 
All texts must be ranked. All ranks must be unique, no ties.
For each text, provide a dictionary in the format: {{"first_name":.., "last_name":..., "company":..., "rank":X}}, where X is the integer rank, 1 is highest (most potential).

For example:
INPUT:
<texts>
<text first_name="John", last_name="Doe", company="Ford Motor Company">
I have just launched a new car, it was red
</text>
<text first_name="Helmut", last_name="Franken", company="BMW">
I have just launched a new version of the BMW3 series, it is targetted at the Chinese market, is red and priced to complete with locallyt manufacturer, BYD.
</text>
<text first_name="Julien", last_name="AuDriscard", company="Renault">
We had a company picnic in celebration of my birthday
</text>
</texts>
YOUR OUTPUT:

[
{{"first_name":"John", "last_name":"Doe", "company":"Ford Motor Company", "rank":2}}
{{"first_name":"Helmut", "last_name":"Franken", "company":"BMW", "rank":1}}
{{"first_name":"Julien", "last_name":"AuDriscard", "company":"Renault", "rank":3}}
]

EXPLANATION:
The above output ranks the text for Helmut Franken at BMW as having the highest potential and detail.
The text for Julien at Renault is unlikely to require a video, so is ranked last.
Therefore, the text for John Doe at Ford must be ranked in between.
